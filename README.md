Create your own channel, and live-stream YouTube channels. People can join your channel and watch along with you.

Rob and I developed this to test out the new (2015) Apple TV. This repo contains both the server code (which I mostly wrote) and the Apple TV app (which Rob mostly wrote). We got a basic version working, but found out in the process that the APIs available for the AppleTV app made it very difficult to create the channel owners experience, requiring a seperate iOS app. This really made the experience much more difficult to imagine people using, so we put the project on pause for now.
